# flask-blog
This is a project on building a blog website using flask. The contents right now mainly follow <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH'>the tutorial of Corey Schafer</a>, which include forms, database, posts, user accounts, authentication, password reset and pagination. I plan to add more elements to the website in the future, such as commenting.
